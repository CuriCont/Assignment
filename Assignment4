[Observations] Voter App 

There were total 3 voters.
2 voted for Cats and 1 voted for Dogs
The result App showed -> Cats - 67% & Dogs - 33%

After this the db pod was deleted.
A New db pod was created & the deleted db pod was in "Terminating" state.
The result App was refreshed.
Obseravations  -

1. Result App stops working.
   Once the DB pod is deleted, A new DB pod is created by K8.
   Result App is still having DB connection with (deleted)old pod.
   Hence Result App stops working.
   
   Solution is to correct the Result App to connect to new DB pod everytime when created.
   By this solution "Resiliency" can be achieved always.
   And any Application issues can be resolved in background to achieve "Robustness" without any service impact.
   
2. Worker pod was restarted.
   Every time when a new DB pod is created, Worker pod restarts itself to connect to the new DB pod.
   Hence it works flawlessly.
   
3. Vote data is Lost
   Vote data is not getting stored in a persistant database.
   Hence everytime the DB pod is deleted data is lost.
   
   Solution is to store the vote data in a persistant DB outside the cluster.
   And when a new DB pod comes up, it needs to "Sync" the data.
   This will result in data "parity" and "accuracy" in all the pods in multi-cluster set-up.
